* Changelogs [Base Difficulty Transfered from 6x2EX ERR]:
- Some of the Send It! Type R features (Hazard 7 Movement Speed, no announced swarm (unless forced) but constant waves with small difficulty, small encounters and stationaries difficulty. FL5 features of downed player = increased wave Interval to prevent snowballing).
- Nitra Cost kept the same as 6x2EX ERR (40 -> 50).
- Small wave now uses WaveSpawner to handle, with mission start delay of 10s. So now it will spawn in every mission types regardless if Normal Wave is disabled in Scenario or not. With this in mind, ECM will be reduced when Additional Swarm is hit in some mission types to prevent the waves being too big. PE has Distance spawn being 35m instead of usual 17.5m.
- Removed previous 6x2EX WaveSpawners because we have Send It! Spawner function already.
- Elites now have increased cooldown timer:
  + Most Elites have +50% CD normally. 
  + Praetorian and Oppressor variants have +80% CD increment instead (Elite Oppressor hidden CD is also +50%). 
  + CD increment doesn't affect Elite Breeder.
- Vartok now only spawns once in every mission type.
- Both Barrage Infector variants have DifficultyRating 200 -> 250.
- Normal Bulk has 33.3% -> 50% chance to be promoted into Elite Bulk.
- Sentinel has 20% -> 25% chance to be promoted into Elite Sentinel.
- During Drillevator Section in Deep Scan, Enemy Movement Speed will be increased by ~30%.
