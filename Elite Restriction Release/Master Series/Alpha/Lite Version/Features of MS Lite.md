* Changelogs of MS Lite comparing to normal MS:
  - Abolish Custom Elite Promotion system. 
  - Some Elite variant enemies are put into normal pool with reasonable setting: Grunt, Web Spitter, Kursite Acid Spitter, Septic, Menace, Bulk, Shellback, Brundle, Rockpox Bomber, Patrol Bot, Breeder, Cave Leech, Spitballer, Barrager, Global Sniper & Repulsion Turret. They still have same stats as MS variant.
  - Oppressor uses cost system instead of VeteranLarge promotion (With limit).
  - Buffing enemy spawn count in WaveSpawner slightly.
