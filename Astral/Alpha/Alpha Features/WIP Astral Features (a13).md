As Astral is still a WIP difficulty, this feature list may be subject to change. This list is updated to a13 version.
This difficulty used 6x2EX - a difficulty made by pH-JPEG, as a framework, but with adjustments. It's also a toned-down version of Celestial.

# General (Mostly the same as 6x2EX)
- Enemy HP, Damage and Movement Speed scaling follows Hazard 6.
- Enemy Count Modifier values are 6x2 values increased by 10%.
- Initial resupply cost is 40 nitra, afterwards it raises to 50 nitra.
- Enemy projectile speed follows Hazard 6.
- Friendly fire is set to 90%.
- You revive with 40% HP and regen up to 40% of your HP compared to the typical 10% seen in Hazard 5 and other modded Hazards. You begin to regenerate your HP after 6 seconds if you don't take any damage. It takes 10 seconds to regenerate from 1 HP to 40% HP once the regeneration begins.
- Dorretta resists 75% of damage; it is the same as the value used in 6x2.
- Whenever an Egg is pulled, if it does not trigger a swarm, the wave it summons spawns x2 the bugs.
- Wave timers are technically based off of Hazard 6.
- High enemy diversity in waves.
- Most caves will have at least one of every Stationary type if possible.
- Some of the enemies can also be promoted into new type of enemies, with own's custom veterans chance.
- Many new enemies have been added in the form of enemies that normally don't spawn in waves and entirely new enemies from CD2, MEV and DEA.
- Some existing enemies have been modified.
- Custom waves of certain enemies spawn at set intervals or conditions.
- Adjusted mission types enemycount mostly to be more balanced, harder in Refinery refining phase, and Drillevator. Slightly easier on Escort Final phase 1 and 2, any phase before Hacking and Caretaker phase in Sabotage, and normal and pressure wave of Deep Scan.
- During the time of Uplink/Refuel/Blackbox objectives, Mission Control will no longer shout at you with "Get back to the triangulation zone! We're losing you" type of quotes if you no one is at triangulation zone. At 1p setting, penalty of draining the progress bar is reduced by 30%.
- Disabled player headbounces.
- Breeder type enemies have lowered Freeze temp.
- Patrol Bot enemies have lower freeze temp. Rival Turrets spawn count in Encounters sabotage mission type is reduced by 35%.
- Lower player scaling will have some change to the existing enemies to make playing easier, especially in 1-2p setting. Such as: Barrager type enemies MaxSpawnCount reduced to 0, and they gain even less SpawnAmountModifier than before. Bulk type enemies are banned during 1p defensive objective. Shockers have added NoSpawnWithin in 1/2p setting, and have spawncount significantly reduced in 1p setting. Escort during Heartstone phase on 1p setting, Doretta gains +25% resistance.
- Added Elimination and Caretaker with wave functionality (via Wave Spawner), so now you can uninstall Elim and Caretaker with waves mod since we have them in my difficulty with better balance.
