As Astral is still a WIP difficulty, this feature list may be subject to change. This list is updated to a19 version.
This difficulty used 6x2EX - a difficulty made by pH-JPEG, as a framework, but with adjustments. It's also a toned-down version of Celestial.

Astral minimum requirement: Custom Difficulty 2 beta 13+, MEVv5_4.
(But I recommend you to update CD2 to latest version)

- Q: Why are Dread and Caretaker with normal wave mod not included in the recommended list above? 
  - A: My difficulty has a dedicated Wave Spawner to simulate normal waves during Dread and Caretaker with 100% accuracy. You don't need Dread and Caretaker with normal wave mod anymore since I've forced this into my difficulty.

* Legends: 
  + During Defense = Uplink/Refuel/Blackbox objectives.
  + 1/2/3/4 = Player Count setting (Left to Right, The last value in the list is used if there are more players than there are values in the list.).
  + 1p = 1 Player Setting.

# General (Mostly the same as 6x2EX)
- Enemy HP, Damage and Movement Speed scaling follows Hazard 6.
- Enemy Count Modifier values are 6x2 values increased by 10%.
- Initial resupply cost is 40 nitra, afterwards it raises to 50 nitra.
- Enemy projectile speed follows Hazard 6.
- Friendly fire is set to 90%.
- You revive with 40% HP and regen up to 40% of your HP compared to the typical 10% seen in Hazard 5 and other modded Hazards. You begin to regenerate your HP after 6 seconds if you don't take any damage. It takes 10 seconds to regenerate from 1 HP to 40% HP once the regeneration begins.
- Dorretta resists 75% of damage (Higher in Solo in certain scenarios); it is the same as the value used in 6x2.
- Whenever an Egg is pulled, if it does not trigger a swarm, the wave it summons spawns x2 the bugs.
- Wave timers are technically based off of Hazard 6.
- High enemy diversity in waves.
- Most caves will have at least one of every Stationary type if possible.
- Many new enemies have been added in the form of enemies that normally don't spawn in waves and entirely new enemies from CD2, MEV and DEA.
- Some existing enemies have been modified (E.G: Some enemies having lower freezing temperatures like Breeders, Bombers and Patrol Bot... - Having some favor for Cryo comp. Elite enemies have lower burn and freeze temperature,...).
- Custom waves of certain enemies spawn at set intervals or conditions.
- Difficulty adjusted across mission types (E.G: PE gets harder, Escort heartstone phase gets easier).
- During Defense at 1p, reduce Progress Bar Penalty by 30%, the value is doubled to 60% if the player is Scout. Also increase Bubble radius by 35%.
- Rival Turrets spawn count in Encounters sabotage mission type is reduced by 35%.
- Lower player scaling will have some change (both Enemies and Objectives) to make playing easier. (E.G: Doretta during Refill and Heartstone phase gains slight increased resistance. No Bulk spawns during Defense. Dangerous run ending at 1p also gets reduced specific values,...)
- Disabled player headbounces.
- Banned Blood Sugar, Low Gravity, Duck and Cover, Ebonite Outbreak and Lithophage Outbreak warnings.

# Custom Waves (Wave Spawners)
- During a Dreadnought fight (OG Dreadnought, Hiveguard, normal Twins), a Bulk Detonator known as a "DreadHelper" with Base HP x0.85 will spawn in to allow the team to kill the Dreadnought faster. Only one DreadHelper can exist at a given time.
- During Dreadnought or Caretaker fight, Normal Wave will spawn in periodically. For Dreadnought fight, the Interval is increased by 50, but the beginning of the fight will guarantee a Normal Wave spawn.
- Every 125 seconds (Longer during certain pressure scenarios), 8-11 non-promoted Grunts spawn.
- Every 100 seconds (Longer during certain pressure scenarios), 1-2 weak Elite Slashers spawns in. This wave spawner no longer spawns in 1p setting.
