As Interstellar is still a WIP difficulty, this feature list may be subject to change. This list is updated to b04 version.
This difficulty used FC_b23 - a difficulty made by pH-JPEG, as a framework, but with adjustments. As a result, this feature list might repeat some lines with same description as FC_b23.

# General (Mostly the same as FC)
- Enemy HP scaling follows Hazard 6.
- Enemy movement speed follows Hazard 7.
- Enemy damage scaling follows Hazard 7.
- Initial resupply cost is 40 nitra, afterwards it raises to 60 nitra.
- Enemy projectile speed follows Hazard 6 and Hazard 7.
- Friendly fire is set to 110%.
- You revive with 40% HP and regen up to 40% of your HP compared to the typical 10% seen in Hazard 5 and other modded Hazards. You begin to regenerate your HP after 6 seconds if you don't take any damage. It takes 10 seconds to regenerate from 1 HP to 40% HP once the regeneration begins.
- Dorretta resists 75% of damage; it is the same as the value used in 6x2.
- During the Extraction phase of a mission or the PE countdown until the Drop Pod lands, x1.66 or x2 more bugs spawn respectively.
- During the time in-between the Fuel Cells and the Drop Pod opening on a Salvage mission, there will initially be a pause in bug spawns with the amount of bugs spawning greatly increasing as the Drop Pod gets closer to opening.
- Whenever an Egg is pulled, if it does not trigger a swarm, the wave it summons spawns x4 the bugs.
- Wave timers are loosely based off of Hazard 7 with low chances for a swarm to spawn instantly, only in Refinery mission type. This wave timer distribution is a slightly on easier side compare to FC.
- A "fat" wave of bugs can occasionally spawn. This is a wave that is twice the size of a typical wave. The chance for "fat" wave was nerfed compare to FC
- Enemy diversity is higher and more variable; this means you can get multiple types of enemies all spawning at once with the amount being variable. You could get a superdiverse wave or a wave of only one or two enemy types.
- Most caves will have at least one of every Stationary type if possible.
- Veteran chance has been significantly increased; this means more Guards, Slashers, Brundles, Trijaws, and Oppressors. Some of the enemies can also be promoted into new type of enemies, with own's custom veterans chance.
- Many new enemies have been added in the form of enemies that normally don't spawn in waves and entirely new enemies from CD2, MEV and DEA.
- Some existing enemies have been modified.
- Custom waves of certain enemies spawn at set intervals or conditions.
- (new) Adjusted mission types enemycount mostly to be more balanced, harder in Refinery refining phase, Escort Final phase 3 and 4, Drillevator and Uplink/Refuel/Blackbox. Slightly easier on Escort Final phase 1 and 2, and normal and pressure wave of Deep Scan.
- (new) During the time of Uplink/Refuel/Blackbox objectives, penalty of draining the progress bar is reduced by 30%, and Mission Control will no longer shout at you with "Get back to the triangulation zone! We're losing you" type of quotes if you no one is at triangulation zone.
