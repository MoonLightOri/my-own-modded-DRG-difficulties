As Celestial is still a WIP difficulty, this feature list may be subject to change. This list is updated to a09 version.
This difficulty used ND - a difficulty made by pH-JPEG, as a framework, but with adjustments. It's also a toned-down version of Interstellar.

# General (Mostly the same as ND)
- Enemy HP scaling follows Hazard 6.
- Enemy movement speed follows Hazard 7.
- Enemy damage scaling follows Hazard 7.
- Initial resupply cost is 40 nitra, afterwards it raises to 50 nitra.
- Enemy projectile speed follows Hazard 6.
- Friendly fire is set to 110%.
- You revive with 40% HP and regen up to 40% of your HP compared to the typical 10% seen in Hazard 5 and other modded Hazards. You begin to regenerate your HP after 6 seconds if you don't take any damage. It takes 10 seconds to regenerate from 1 HP to 40% HP once the regeneration begins.
- Dorretta resists 75% of damage; it is the same as the value used in 6x2.
- During the Extraction phase of a mission or the PE countdown until the Drop Pod lands, x1.35 or x1.6 more bugs spawn respectively.
- During the time in-between the Fuel Cells and the Drop Pod opening on a Salvage mission, there will initially be a pause in bug spawns with the amount of bugs spawning greatly increasing as the Drop Pod gets closer to opening.
- Whenever an Egg is pulled, if it does not trigger a swarm, the wave it summons spawns x3 the bugs.
- Wave timers are technically based off of Hazard 7.
- A "fat" wave of bugs can occasionally spawn. This is a wave that is twice the size of a typical wave. The chance for "fat" wave was nerfed compare to FC/IS/ND.
- Enemy diversity is higher and more variable; this means you can get multiple types of enemies all spawning at once with the amount being variable. You could get a superdiverse wave or a wave of only one or two enemy types.
- Most caves will have at least one of every Stationary type if possible.
- Veteran chance has been significantly increased; this means more Guards, Slashers, Brundles, Trijaws, and Oppressors. Some of the enemies can also be promoted into new type of enemies, with own's custom veterans chance.
- Many new enemies have been added in the form of enemies that normally don't spawn in waves and entirely new enemies from CD2, MEV and DEA.
- Some existing enemies have been modified.
- Custom waves of certain enemies spawn at set intervals or conditions.
- Adjusted mission types enemycount mostly to be more balanced, harder in Refinery refining phase, Hacking phase in Sabotage, Escort Final phase 3 and 4, Drillevator and Uplink/Refuel/Blackbox. Slightly easier on Escort Final phase 1 and 2, any phase before Hacking and Caretaker phase in Sabotage, and normal and pressure wave of Deep Scan. Significantly easier in Refinery Stalling/Reparing phase.
- During the time of Uplink/Refuel/Blackbox objectives, penalty of draining the progress bar is reduced by 30%, and Mission Control will no longer shout at you with "Get back to the triangulation zone! We're losing you" type of quotes if you no one is at triangulation zone.
- Disabled player headbounces.
- Breeder type enemies have lowered Freeze temp.
- Rival turrets and Patrol Bot enemies have lower freeze temp.
- Added x1.2 NitraMultiplier on specific mission type (Length:Complexity) Mining 2:1, DeepScan 1:2, Sabotage 2:1 and Sabotage 2:2. The reason behind this is these specific mission type has significantly way lower Nitra generation than the only slightly longer or bigger missions, which can cause Attrition issue very fast.
- Lower player scaling will have some change to the existing enemies to make playing easier, especially in 1-2p setting. Such as: Increase Player Light Intensity by 50% if Scout doesn't present. Spitscreen Infector has -33.3% Time Dilation. Barrager type enemies MaxSpawnCount reduced to 0, and they gain signficantly less SpawnAmountModifier than before, (1p setting only) their HP stats is reduced to be the same as Spitballer's and gain 100% weakness to fire like Spitballer. Bulk type enemies are banned during 1p defensive objective. Shockers have added NoSpawnWithin in 1/2p setting, and have spawncount significantly reduced in 1p setting.

# Custom Waves
- During a Dreadnought fight (OG Dreadnought, Hiveguard, normal Twins), a Bulk Detonator known as a "DreadHelper" will spawn in to allow the team to kill the Dreadnought faster. Only one DreadHelper can exist at a given time. The DreadHelper moves x1.5 faster.

CaretakerHelper has only 1400 Base HP (4000 HP normal bulk), with only x1.2 movement speed instead (normal bulk x1.5), and the carve radius is the same as minibulk. Its look is changed via CD2. Spawnspread is the same as DreadHelper Wavespawner.
- At the start of a mission, a Canary or two spawns in. It is a big, slow swarmer with a boss HP bar. It is meant to detect desync between clients on CD2.

Elite Septic Spreader once spawned will have a cooldown timer of 280s/210s in 1/2+ player setting before being able to spawn again in this wavespawner.

# Miscellaneous:
- Bandaid bug fix: Darkness module somehow caused scout's flare gun to have significantly less duration time so i added FlareGunDuration field value in Darkness module file, so it matches 90s of duration (1 duration upgrade) most scout upgrade path will take.
